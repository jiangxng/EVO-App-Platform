## Current milestone

Personal Agent P1.8 — Conversation Lifecycle & Retention
ACTIVE
```

## Latest closed live slice

**p1.8b-conversation-retention-policy: VERIFIED_LIVE_PASS**

Human selected a 90-day archived-thread retention policy. The effective policy is readable, default preview uses 90 days, production config explicitly records 90 days, ACTIVE threads remain ineligible, and destructive purge is disabled.

Authority: `docs/roadmap/P1.8-CONVERSATION-LIFECYCLE-RETENTION.md`

```

## Current open live gate

**p1.8c-eidos-thread-management: IMPLEMENTATION_READY**

Expose durable Conversation Thread lifecycle in Eidos without changing authority boundaries: explicit New Chat, scoped history, switch/reopen, archive, selected-thread refresh continuity, and no discourse carry-over between thread IDs.

Acceptance:

- New Chat creates a fresh durable threadId
- New Chat does not reuse prior thread Host history
- thread history is loaded from Host thread.list
- switching thread loads that thread's Host transcript
- archived threads remain reopenable read-only
- archive action uses Host scoped thread.archive
- selected thread survives refresh/re-mount
- no browser conversationHistory becomes authority
- no Context Memory side effect
- legacy run-backed fallback occurs only before durable thread authority exists

## Project continuity live validation

**Status:** `LIVE_PASS`

**Scenario:** `FRESH_CHATGPT_CONVERSATION_COLD_START`

USER_CONFIRMED_CURRENT_PROJECT_PROGRESS_WAS_RECOVERED

Authority: `docs/roadmap/PROJECT-CONTINUITY-LIVE-CERTIFICATION.md`

Proved:

- fresh ChatGPT conversation can recover current project progress from repository-native bootstrap state
- previous ChatGPT transcript is not required for basic continuation
- stale dated handoff no longer determines current project state when bootstrap protocol is followed

Not proved:

- every future model will obey bootstrap without being instructed
- all project details can be reconstructed without task-specific authority documents

## DO NOT repeat stale actions

- Do not accept memory-proposal:dc107947-7016-4e33-8c20-b328bcc4030f as the deduplication mechanism.
- Do not accept the P1.5B smoke-test Proposal memory-proposal:55b2b06e-8361-43f9-8f22-408aae7a8f1b as formal Memory; it is test-only and currently PENDING.
- Do not accept the P1.5C smoke-test Proposal memory-proposal:974893e1-6a91-4473-8de8-e3e395342f62 as formal Memory; it is test-only and currently PENDING.
- Do not create or accept another A→B canonicalization for the known 17:00 duplicate pair; canonicalization is already LIVE PASS.
- Do not reopen P1.4X or P1.5A/B/C as active gates unless a new regression provides current evidence.
- Do not use ranked retrieval as governance inventory.
- Do not automatically repeat a material Agent WRITE when its durable receipt is REQUESTED without a terminal event.
- Do not treat an Action Receipt as replacement for domain authoritative state.
- Do not make run recovery depend on browser conversation memory or one long synchronous HTTP request.
- Do not let resume implicitly cross a Human approval boundary.
- Do not recommend governance work that authoritative current state already shows as completed.
- Do not remove enterprise-agent.chat compatibility until the run-backed Eidos path is certified.
- Do not accept the P1.5B smoke-test Proposal memory-proposal:55b2b06e-8361-43f9-8f22-408aae7a8f1b as formal Memory; it is test-only.
- Do not reintroduce enterprise-agent.chat as the primary Personal Agent transport; durable run-backed orchestration is now the default.
- Do not fall back to legacy chat after a durable run has been created.
- Do not make durable conversation threads the authority for Context Memory facts.
- Do not store hidden model chain-of-thought in conversation threads.
- Do not require the browser to resubmit durable thread history once P1.7 thread-backed turns are active.
- Do not restart P1.4X, P1.5 or P1.6 work unless a new regression provides current evidence.
- Do not reopen P1.7 thread durability as the active gate unless a new regression provides current evidence.
- Do not treat durable conversation messages as Context Memory authority; promotion still requires governed Memory Proposal/Review.
- Do not implement ordinary thread deletion as in-place mutation; P1.8 lifecycle/retention must remain auditable.
- Do not let 'New Chat' reuse the prior threadId or Host-built history once P1.8C is implemented.
- Do not reuse Context Memory retention semantics automatically for conversation threads.

## Fresh ChatGPT / LLM startup

A fresh session must read, in order:

1. `AI-BOOTSTRAP.md`
2. `project.status.json`
3. `docs/roadmap/HANDOFF-LATEST.md`
4. `LLM.md`
5. `llm.foundation-map.json`

The repository state wins over ChatGPT Memory, model memory, prior assistant summaries and dated handoff guesses.

A dated handoff is historical evidence unless `project.status.json.handoff` points to it.

## Fresh-session continuity acceptance

A new ChatGPT / LLM session is project-continuous only if it can do all of the following after the startup read:

- state current milestone as Personal Agent P1.8 — Conversation Lifecycle & Retention
- state P1.8A and P1.8B as verified and production-live
- state archived Conversation Thread retention as 90 days from archivedAt
- state destructive purge remains disabled and was not authorized by the 90-day decision
- state P1.8C Eidos thread management as the current open gate
- state current deployed runtime revision 33301b49ddf4bdd36fec57097ea989326d28038a
- explain true irreversible erasure is a separate future security boundary, not a logical tombstone
- do not require the previous ChatGPT transcript to continue

No previous ChatGPT transcript is required.

## State-layer distinction

```text
Conversation History
= current-chat discourse continuity

ChatGPT / model Memory
= selective cross-chat assistance, not authoritative project state

Context Memory
= governed product-level durable knowledge

Project Status + HANDOFF-LATEST
= authoritative engineering-project continuity

Host READ
= current runtime/platform truth
```
